This repository includes two files named Top10.ipynb and Parking.ipynb. Our basic dataset consisting of calls to the 311 phone number for non-emergency services in New York City. Each call to 311 has a number of datapoints tracked and aggregated. The basic dataset is named 311_Service_Requests_2020.csv.
(When we import the csv file, we ingore the warning.)

Explanation on the Top10.ipynb:
# In the Top10.ipynb, we import the 311_Service_Requests_2020.csv as df;
In the first step, we select the incident zip = 11101 as the zipcode subset;

In the second step, we identify the create time variable, and create a new column-year;
Then we set the year=2020 as the zip subset named year2020;

In the third step, since we want to find the top10 complaint type,
so we derive the complaint type column from year2020 subset; 

At last, we count the top10 causes of calls to 311 are in the zipcode 11101
From the final result, the top 10 causes in 11101 in the year 2020 is below:

Illegal Parking                        2982
Noise - Residential                    2030
Noise - Street/Sidewalk                1220
Blocked Driveway                       1034
Non-Emergency Police Matter             904
Street Condition                        670
NonCompliance with Phased Reopening     649
Noise                                   608
Noise - Commercial                      512
Noise - Vehicle                         374
Name: Complaint Type, dtype: int64

From the result you can see that the illegal parking takes the most causes(2982), 
and the noise-vehivle is the last one in the top10 (374).
